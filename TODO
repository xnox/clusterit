Fix handling of g in loops.  If you have a massive cluster, and pick
two sparse groups in it.. it will run twice, rather than once..

Break apart do_command in dsh.c to something sane.

create a common subdir and try to share more subroutines

Move strcat to common for non BSD builds

create makefile patch for SUNWpro C, and SUN gnu C.  (assistance here would 
be greatly appreciated)

instead of showing stdout, followed by stderr in dsh, use poll or select to
multiplex the input and show it like it would actually appear on the remote
servers.

make dshbak more useful.  The IBM format is nasty.

pdf could probably use a little work.

supper  <groan>

make bailout() able to provide real data about failures.  Move into common, or
perhaps make it a macro.

Remove #ifdef DEBUG and use a -d for a switchable debugging flag.

Make a common header file of some sort.

could alignstring be a macro?
