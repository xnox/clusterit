LUMPS, which would be groups of GROUPS, to allow a sort of virtual group.
ie: you could have functions in groups, like mail, www, etc.. and have machine
type lumps, for example, all NetBSD, all hpux, for other types of
machine-specific administration.

finish jsd, jsh

Port interrupt handling to seq and run.

Break apart do_command in dsh.c to something sane.

create makefile patch for SUNWpro C, and SUN gnu C.  (assistance here would 
be greatly appreciated)

instead of showing stdout, followed by stderr in dsh, use poll or select to
multiplex the input and show it like it would actually appear on the remote
servers.

make dshbak more useful.  The IBM format is nasty.

pdf could probably use a little work.

Fixed post 1.3
	Fix handling of g in loops.  If you have a massive cluster, and pick
	two sparse groups in it.. it will run twice, rather than once..

	make bailout() able to provide real data about failures.  Move into
	common, or perhaps make it a macro.

	Remove #ifdef DEBUG and use a -d for a switchable debugging flag.

	Make a common header file of some sort.

	could alignstring be a macro?

	create a common subdir and try to share more subroutines

	Move strsep to common for non BSD builds
