.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is a VT100 terminal emulator for X.  It is intended as
a partial replacement for
.Xr xterm 1
for users who do not require the more esoteric features of
.Xr xterm 1 .
Specifically
.Nm
does not implement the Tektronix 4014 emulation, session logging
and toolkit style configurability. As a result,
.Nm
uses much less swap space than
.Xr xterm 1 ,
a significant advantage on a machine serving many X sessions.
.Pp
The
.Nm
program is based on the
.Xr xvt 1
terminal emulator.  However, it has been modified specificly for use
with the
.Xr dvt 1
program.  It may be used as a stand-alone application, but it is not
suggested that the user do so. The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width www
.It Fl l Ar username
If the program specified by the
.Ev RLOGIN_CMD
environment variable allows the user to pass a username with a
.Fl l
option
.Po
Such as some versions of
.Xr rsh 1
or
.Xr ssh 1
.Pc
then the
.Nm
program will pass the appropriate flags to the remote-connection
command to attempt to connect to the remote machine as the username
specified.
.It Fl display Ar display-name
Attempt to open the
.Nm
window on the named X display.  In the absence of this option, the
display specified by the
.Ev DISPLAY
environment variable will be used.
.It Fl geometry Ar window-geometry
Create the window with the specified X window geometry.
.It Fl background Ar color
Use the specified color as the window's background color.
.It Fl bg Ar color
This option is a synonym for
.Fl background
.It Fl foreground Ar color
Use the specified color as the window's foreground color.
.It Fl fg Ar color
This option is a synonym for
.Fl foreground
.It Fl bd Ar color
Set the border color.  As with border width, this option will usually
be disregarded with respect to the window's outer border.  It does,
however, set the color of the line separating the scroll bar from the
main part of the window.
.It Fl bw Ar number
Set the window border width to
.Ar number
pixels.  Many window managers ignore existing window borders and
contruct their own.  If you are using such a window manager, this
option will be ignored.
.It Fl font Ar fontname
Set the main text font to be used by
.Nm
.It Fl fb Ar fontname
Set the font used for the vt100 bold rendition style.  Unlike
.Xr xterm 1 ,
the current version of
.Nm
will not try and create bold text by displacing and or'ing an
ordinary font.  Therefore if you want bold highlighting to work, you
need to use this option to specify a suitable bold font.
.It Fl name Ar name
Set the name that is used when looking up X resource values for this
instance of
.Nm .
.It Fl sl Ar number
Set an upper bound for the number of lines of text that will be saved
when they have scrolled off the top of the window.
.It Fl cc Ar char-class
Input or modify the character classes that are used to determine what
is a word when a double-click is used to select a word of displayed
text.  This is identical to the same option in
.Xr xterm 1 .
See the
.Xr xterm 1
manual page for a description of the syntax of
.Ar string .
.It Fl sb
Start up with the scrollbar visible.  The scrollbar can be displayed
or hidden at any time, simply by holding down the CONTROL key on the
keyboard and pressing any mouse button.  The visibility of the
scrollbar does not determine whether scrolled text is saved or not, as
with
.Xr xterm 1 ,
text scrolled off the top of the window is always saved up to the
current maximum number of lines.
.It Fl rw
Enable reverse wrapping of the cursor, so that lines typed to a shell
that are longer than the width of the screen can be edited.  This is
the same as the
.Xr xterm 1
reverse wrap option.
.It Fl msg
Enable messages to the terminal window from programs like
.Xr write 1 .
By default,
.Nm
windows have messages disabled.  Executing an
.Nm
window with the
.Fl msg
option has the same effect as running it normally, and executing the
command
.So
mesg y
.Sc
to enable messages.
.It Fl iconic
Start up with the window already iconized.
.Ar remote-machine
The name of a remote machine to connect to.  The connection attempt is
made via the program specified by the
.Ev RLOGIN_CMD
environment variable.
.El
.Sh X RESOURCES
Most of the command line options have X resource counterparts and
these are listed in the following table.  Like
.Xr xterm 1 ,
.Nm
uses the class name XTerm, so resource options set for XTerm will work
for both
.Xr xterm 1
and
.Nm
windows.
.Ss Command line options and X resources
.Bl -column "-background" "borderWidth" "borderWidth" -compact

.El
.Sh THE SCROLL BAR
Lines of text that scroll off the top of the
.Nm
window are saved
automatically
.Po
up to a preset maximum number
.Pc
and can be viewed by scrolling them back into the window with the
scrollbar.  The scrollbar itself can be displayed or hidden by
clicking any mouse button in the window while holding down the
CONTROL key on the keyboard.  When using the scrollbar, the left and
right mouse buttons are used for scrolling by a few lines at a time
and the middle button is used for continuous scrolling.  To use the
middle button, press it in the scroll bar and hold it down. The
central shaded part of the scrollbar will then attach itself to the
cursor and can be slid up or down to show different parts of the
sequence of saved lines.  When scrolling with the left and right
buttons, the left button is used to scroll up and the right is used to
scroll down. Assuming that there are enough hidden lines, the distance
scrolled with either button is equal to the number of lines between
the cursor and the top of the window. Hence, pressing the left cursor
opposite a line of text will result in that line being moved to be the
top of the window and pressing the right button will cause the top
line to be moved down so that it is opposite the cursor.
.Sh TEXT SELECTION AND INSERTION
.Nm Rvt
uses the same kind of text selection and insertion mechanism as
.Xr xterm 1 .
Pressing and releasing the middle mouse button in an
.Nm rvt
window causes the current text selection to be inserted as if it had
been typed on the keyboard. For the insertion to take place, both
the button press and the button release need to be done with the
cursor in the
.Nm
window.
.Pp
The left and right mouse buttons are used to select text, with the
left button being used to start a selection and the right button being
used to modify an existing selection. Any continuous block of
displayed text can be selected. If both ends of the text block are
visible in the window then the easiest way to select it is to position
the cursor at one end and press the left mouse button, then
drag the cursor to the other end with the button held down before
releasing the button. If the block is larger than the window then you
must first use the left mouse button to select one end, then use the
scroll bar to scroll the other end into view and finally use the right
mouse button to extend the selection. The effect of pressing the right
mouse button is to move the nearest end of the current selection to
the current cursor position.
.Pp
The other way to make selections in
.Nm
is to use double and triple clicks of the left mouse button with a
double click selecting a word and a triple click selecting a whole
line. For this purpose, a word is a sequence of characters in the same
class.  The default character classes are:
.Bl -bullet -offset "hello"
.It
The upper and lower case letters, digits and
.Sq _
.Pq underscore
all in one class;
.It
The white space characters all in one class;
.It
Each of the remaining punctuation characters in a class by itself.
.El
.Pp
If you want to change the character classes so that, for example,
you can select a
.Ux
pathname or a mail address in one double click,
then you can do so by using the
.Fl cc
command line option or the
.Em charClass
X resource.  Multiple clicking can be combined with dragging to
select a sequence of consecutive words or lines.
.Pp
Although
.Nm
essentially mimics the behaviour of
.Xr xterm 1
in its support of text selection and insertion, there are a couple of
minor differences:
.Bl -bullet -offset "hello"
.It
.Nm
respects TAB characters in selected text and does not
automatically convert them into spaces as does
.Xr xterm 1 ;
.It
.Nm
will let you abort a text insertion if you realize you have made a
mistake before releasing the middle mouse button.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
utilizes the following environment variables.
.Bl -tag -width "RLOGIN_CMD"
.It Ev DISPLAY
The default X server that the client should connect to.
.It Ev RLOGIN_CMD
The default command that will be run to connect to the remote host.
This can be anything from
.Xr rsh 1 ,
.Xr ssh 1 ,
to
.Xr telnet 1
because
.Nm
is an interactive process, automatic authentication is not
required as it is with
.Xr dsh 1 .
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 on success, 1 if an error occurs.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr xterm 1 ,
.Xr dsh 1 ,
.Xr xvt 1 ,
.Xr telnet 1 ,
.Xr rsh 1 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in clusterit 2.0.
.Sh AUTHOR
.Nm Rvt
is based on the program
.Xr xvt 1
written by John Bovey, University of Kent, in 1992.  Modifications to
make this program compile on modern machines, and work with
.Xr dvt 1
were made by Tim Rightnour.
.Sh BUGS
Pasting very large quantities of text does not work.
