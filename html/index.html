<p>Not much to say here right now.. just your average computer geek.  My
interests include NetBSD, parallel computing, and other bizarre things.

<p>A <a href="machines.gif">picture</a> of some of my machines.  In this photo you can see polaris,
castor, pollux, rigel, and alshain.  Look closely at the LED displays on the two desktop cases.

particular photo.

<p><a href="http://www.netbsd.org">NetBSD</a> is my operating system of choice.  I've been using NetBSD since version
0.8 when it first came out, and have been an avid (rabid?) supporter ever
since.  Recently I became a developer for NetBSD.  Right now I'm mainly doing
package work.. but I'm becoming more and more dangerous every day!
<p>Projects I am working on for NetBSD:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/mlist">NetBSD Mail Archives on the Web</a>
<li> <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/alpha/index.html">Porting packages to NetBSD/alpha</a>
<li> <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/software/packages.html">The NetBSD Package System</a>
<li> <a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/parallel/README.html">Parallelism on NetBSD</a>
</ul>

<p>ClusterIt is a software package I've been working on recently.  It is
a group of utilities and commands for <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Misc/call-it-a-duck.html">UNIX</a>, which make possible a distributed
computing environment on any old random pile of unix machines.  More
information on ClusterIt is available <a href="clusterit.html">here</a> on my
ClusterIt page.
