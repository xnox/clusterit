takes input from the dsh command, and formats it to look nicer for the user.

it in a header above the output for that node.  This is generally useful for
commands that make output larger than 80 columns when prepended with the
nodename.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
clusterit 1.0.  It is based on the
.Nm
command in IBM PSSP.

was written by Tim Rightnour.
