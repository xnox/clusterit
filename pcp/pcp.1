.Sh NAME
.Nm pcp
.Nd copy a file to a cluster of machines
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar -r
.Op Ar -p
.Op Ar -w node1,...,nodeN
.Ar source_file
.Op destination file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
utility can be used to copy a file, or directory to a group of machines.
The group of machines can be listed on the command line, or default to
the environment setting
.Ev CLUSTER
.
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width www
.It Fl p
The
.Fl p
option causes
.Nm
to attempt to preserve (duplicate) in its copies the modification
times and modes of the source files, ignoring the
.Ar umask  .
By default, the mode and owner of
.Ar file2
are preserved if it already existed; otherwise the mode of the source file
modified by the
.Xr umask  2
on the destination host is used.
.It Fl r
If any of the source files are directories,
.Nm
copies each subtree rooted at that name; in this case
the destination must be a directory.
.It Fl w
If the
.Fl w
option is specified, followed by a comma delimited list of machine names,
the
.Ar command
will be run on each node in the list.  Without this flag,
.Nm
runs on the nodes listed in the file pointed to by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
utilizes the following environment variables.
.Bl -tag -width "RCP_CMD"
.It Ev CLUSTER
Contains a filename, which is a newline separated list of nodes
in the cluster.
.It Ev RCP_CMD
Command to use to copy files to remote machines.  The command chosen must
be able to connect with no password to the remote host.  Defaults to
.Ic rcp
.\" .Sh FILES
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Pp
pcp file
.Pp
will copy the file 'file' to the home directory of the current user on
all machines listed in the file pointed to by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment setting.
.Pp
.Pp
The command:
.Pp
pcp -w hadar,rigel file
.Pp
will copy the file 'file' to the home directory of the current user
on the machines 'hadar' and 'rigel'.
.Pp
.Pp
The command:
.Pp
pcp -w hadar,rigel /usr/bin/foo /usr/local/bin/foo
.Pp
will copy the file '/usr/bin/foo' to '/usr/local/bin/foo' on the
machines 'hadar' and 'rigel'.
.Pp

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 on success, 1 if an error occurs.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in clusterit 1.0. It is based on the
.Nm
command in IBM PSSP.

.Nm Pcp
was written by Tim Rightnour.
.Sh BUGS
Error handling could use some work.
