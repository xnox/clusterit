.Sh NAME
.Nm pcp
.Nd copy a file to a cluster of machines
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar -c
.Op Ar -e
.Op Ar -r
.Op Ar -p
.Op Ar -f fanout
.Op Ar -g rungroup1,...,rungroupN
.Op Ar -w node1,...,nodeN
.Op Ar -x node1,...,nodeN
.Ar source_file1
.Op source_file2 ... source_fileN
.Op destination file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
utility can be used to copy a file, or directory to a group of machines.
The group of machines can be listed on the command line, or default to
the environment setting
.Ev CLUSTER
.
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width www
.It Fl c
Normally 
.Nm 
copies files serially, to all the nodes specified.  When the
.Fl c
option is used,
.Nm
will copy the files in parallel to the nodes, subject to the
.Ev FANOUT
environment setting and
.Fl f
option.  Smaller files will benefit greatly from parallel copies,
due to reduced latency in the initial authentication, and connection.
However, large files, especially on a shared ethernet, will suffer
tremendous speed degredation, because of the collisions the transfers
will create.  This effect can be reduced, by lowering the fanout size
of the cluster.
.It Fl e
Unless the
.Fl e
option is specified, output from remote commands will not be reported to the user.
.It Fl p
The
.Fl p
option causes
.Nm
to attempt to preserve (duplicate) in its copies the modification
times and modes of the source files, ignoring the
.Ar umask  .
By default, the mode and owner of
.Ar file2
are preserved if it already existed; otherwise the mode of the source file
modified by the
.Xr umask  2
on the destination host is used.
.It Fl r
If any of the source files are directories,
.Nm
copies each subtree rooted at that name; in this case
the destination must be a directory.
.It Fl f
If the
.Fl f
option is specified, followed by a number, it sets the fanout size of the cluster.  The
fanout size is the number of nodes a command will run on in parallel at one time.  Thus
a 80 node cluster, with a fanout size of 64, would run 64 nodes in parallel, then, when
all have finished, it would execute the command on the last 16 nodes.  The fanout size
defaults to 64.  This option overrides the
.Ev FANOUT
environment variable.
.It Fl g
If the
.Fl g
option is specified, followed by a comma separated list of group names, the command will only be run on that group
of nodes.  A node may be a part of more than one group if desired, however running without the
.Fl g
option will run the command on the same node as many times as it appears in the
file specified by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable.  This option is silently ignored if used with the
.Fl w
option.
.It Fl w
If the
.Fl w
option is specified, followed by a comma delimited list of machine names,
the
.Ar command
will be run on each node in the list.  Without this flag,
.Nm
runs on the nodes listed in the file pointed to by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment variable.
.It Fl x
The
.Fl x
option can be used to exclude specific nodes from the cluster.  The format is the same as
the
.Fl w
option, a comma delimited list of machine names.  This option is silently ignored if used with the
.Fl w
option.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
utilizes the following environment variables.
.Bl -tag -width "RCP_CMD"
.It Ev CLUSTER
Contains a filename, which is a newline separated list of nodes
in the cluster.
.It Ev RCP_CMD
Command to use to copy files to remote machines.  The command chosen must
be able to connect with no password to the remote host.  Defaults to
.Ic rcp
.It Ev FANOUT
When set, limits the maximum number of concurrent commands sent at once.  This can be
used to keep from overloading a small host when sending out commands in parallel.  Defaults to
64.  This environment setting can be overridden by the
.Fl f
option.
.\" .Sh FILES
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command:
.Pp
pcp file
.Pp
will copy the file 'file' to the home directory of the current user on
all machines listed in the file pointed to by the
.Ev CLUSTER
environment setting.
.Pp
.Pp
The command:
.Pp
pcp -w hadar,rigel file
.Pp
will copy the file 'file' to the home directory of the current user
on the machines 'hadar' and 'rigel'.
.Pp
.Pp
The command:
.Pp
pcp -w hadar,rigel /usr/bin/foo /usr/local/bin/foo
.Pp
will copy the file '/usr/bin/foo' to '/usr/local/bin/foo' on the
machines 'hadar' and 'rigel'.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is 0 on success, 1 if an error occurs.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in clusterit 1.0. It is based on the
.Nm
command in IBM PSSP.
.Sh AUTHOR
.Nm Pcp
was written by Tim Rightnour.
.Sh BUGS
Error handling could use some work.
