Clusterit as of version 2.3, now uses autoconf/automake to build rather than
Makefiles and a set of patches for various OS's.  You should simply be
able to run:

./configure
make
make install

This should build and install clusterit in /usr/local/.  You can use the
--prefix argument to configure to change that location.  Note that dvt/rvt
requires X11 to build.  If you should wish to build without these, you
should be able to simply delete them from the SUBDIRS lines in the toplevel
Makefile.

Please send any and all patches to my email if you make any fixes or
enhancements to the source, I will gladly apply them.
