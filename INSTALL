Hints for installing/compiling on various platforms.

AIX:  if you are using gcc, simply run `patch -p 0 <make.aix.gcc' in the
clusterit-1.2/ directory.  This will patch most of the Makefiles to what
needs to be there for a proper gcc build on AIX.

If you are using IBM C (tested with 4.4 C on AIX 4.3.2) you can use
`patch -p 0 <make.aix.ibmc' to prepare the makefiles for use with IBM C.

Please let me know if anything goes wrong with these.

After your Makefiles are in order, you should just be able to do a
make , followed by a make install.
